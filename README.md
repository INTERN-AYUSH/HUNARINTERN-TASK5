# HUNARINTERN-TASK5
ðŸŽ‰ Exciting News! ðŸŽ‰
I'm thrilled to announce that I've successfully completed my 5th task during my internship at HunarIntern!
This task involved a comprehensive UI design overhaul of the medical booking process.
It was a challenging yet rewarding experience.
Iâ€™m proud to see my design skills contributing to a more user-friendly and efficient system.
Looking forward to the next challenge and continuing to grow as a UI/UX designer!
